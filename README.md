# BT Accessibility Extension
This project is a prototype browser extension developed for my Bachelors Thesis. Its capabilities are to analyze an e-learning website using Axe to get an accurate summary of problems, and then the website is also analyzed with a more contextual focus by ChatGPT, which then aims to result in a more accurate tool-generated evaluation than usual.
